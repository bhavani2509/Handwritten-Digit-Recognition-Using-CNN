# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition-Using-CNN
Developed a machine learning model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to recognize handwritten digits  with high 
accuracy. Utilized the MNIST dataset, which consists of normalized and centered images of digits (0â€“9), to train the model for 
multi-class classification. Implemented the model using TensorFlow and Keras, with supporting data handling libraries such as 
NumPy and Pandas. The system processes image inputs similarly to human visual perception and demonstrates real-time digit 
classification for computer vision tasks.
